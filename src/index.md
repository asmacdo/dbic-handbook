# Dartmouth Brain Imaging Center Handbook

## Introduction

Welcome to DBIC! Here, you'll find the documentation you'll need to
complete your research here at Dartmouth. As it turns out, neuroscience is hard, 
you will need many tools to collect and manage your data (which might
be huge!). It turns out, neuroscience also requires a LOT of
calculation. It is likely you will need to learn some foundational
skills as a Linux Terminal user, and you will likely need to interact
with Dartmouth's supercomputing cluser, "Discovery". 


## 1 crazy tip that everyone should know

This handbook is (hopefully) lovingly maintained by DBIC users. If there's
technology that many of you need to learn, add it here. 

If something is difficult or impossible, add it here.
Consider this handbook your gift the the next generation of unfortunate
researchers who have just been smited by 1 million tools to learn.
